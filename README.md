## Basics of HTML & CSS

**HTML and CSS** are two of the *foundational building blocks* of pretty much everything on the web.

**HTML** works together **CSS**, two languages that create everything you see when you look at something on the Internet.

**HTML** provides structure and meaning to our text: it creates all the text, links, cards, lists, and buttons.
**CSS** is what adds style to those plain elements.
**HTML** puts information on a webpage.
**CSS** positions that information, gives it color, changes the font, and makes it look great!
