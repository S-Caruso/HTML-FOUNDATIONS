### Introduction to HTML & CSS

**The relation between HTML and CSS** is strongly tied together since HTML is the very foundation of a site and CSS is all of the aesthetics of an entire website.

In simple words:<br>
**HTML** provides **structure** and **meaning** to the web page<br>
**CSS** allows to precisely **style** it
