### Introduction to HTML & CSS

**HTML** and **CSS** are two of the *building blocks* of Web Development.

**HTML** (*HyperText Markup Language*)<br>
A fundamental **markup language** that determines both the **structure** and **content** of a web page.<br>
This markup tells a web browser how to display text, images and other forms of multimedia.<br>
It is able to create: paragraphs, lists, headings, layout, links, multimedia players, forms, tables and many more elements.

**CSS** (*Cascading Style Sheets*)<br>
Popular **style sheet language** used for specifying **styling** and **presentation** of a document written in a **markup language** as HTML.<br>
Used to style the content of a web page, it lets developers control the visual appearance of websites through typographic characteristics, colour properties, and overall layout of web pages.

**The relation between HTML and CSS** is strongly tied together since HTML is the very foundation of a site and CSS is all of the aesthetics of an entire website.

In simple words:<br>
**HTML** provides **structure** and **meaning** to the web page<br>
**CSS** allows to precisely **style** it
